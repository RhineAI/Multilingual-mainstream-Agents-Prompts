Over a dozen versions of Prompts containing mainstream AI Agents tools or IDE such as [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and [Manus](https://manus.im/), making it more convenient for everyone to learn

Forked from the upstream repository, all content is automatically translated using [Claude 4 Opus](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4) model through configured [GitHub Actions CI](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). When new files are committed to any language folder, translation workflow is automatically triggered to synchronize across all language directories.
